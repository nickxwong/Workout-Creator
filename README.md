# Workout Creator
Workout Creator is a full stack web application I created to help me and other users plan out workout programs. Users can select from a list of exercises or even create their own. Signed-in users can also save workouts for later reference or editing. 

# Languages & Technologies
On the front-end, Workout Creator was built with the React framework. On the back-end, the application runs with Node.js and Express. Persistent storage of exercises, workouts, and user accounts is achieved with a MySQL database. The entire website is hosted on Heroku.
